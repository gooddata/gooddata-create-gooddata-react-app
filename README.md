# GoodData Create React App

This is a CLI tool that creates a new React project with a proxy set up to connect to your projects on the GoodData platform.
The new app features some widgets and helpers that could come in handy.
The app is built on top of Create React App. For more info see [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/).

## How to use

To create a project called `my-app`, run this in your terminal:

```bash
npx --ignore-existing @gooddata/create-gooddata-react-app my-app
```

Then follow the instructions provided by the CLI.

When navigating to your application using an IP address instead of localhost, you may run into `401` errors while trying to log in. This is due to proxying and cookie rewriting rules that the generated application uses to get around CORS. Use localhost instead of IP addresses to access the application because the development server rewrites GDC cookies to be for localhost.

_NOTE:_ We use `yarn` dependency manager. To install it, follow its [documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). If you don't want to use `yarn`, provide the `--no-install` flag like `npx @gooddata/create-gooddata-react-app my-app --no-install` . This will skip calling `yarn install` and you will have to manually install the dependencies of the created app. Please note that we do not provide `package-lock.json` so the application may not work properly when dependencies are installed using `npm`.

## CLI usage

`@gooddata/create-gooddata-react-app` supports several optional flags:

-   `--hostname <hostname>` URL of your GoodData host
-   `-c, --config <config>` path to configuration file (see below)
-   `--no-install` skip yarn installing the app dependencies
-   `--verbose` output additional logs, useful mainly for debugging and bug reports
-   `-h, --help` output usage information
-   `--backend <backend>` switch backend to a desired one (default: `bear`)
-   `--flavor <flavor>` desired flavor of the application: `js` for JavaScript, `ts` for TypeScript
